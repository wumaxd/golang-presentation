# Further steps with go in your organization

## Pros/Cons of Go

Pros:
- Fast builds
- Performance
- Comprehensibility: easy & quick to develop, focus on readability
- Linguistic stability: The "Go 1 promise"
- Memory safety
- Static linking
- great standard library and huge ecosystem of open source libraries

Cons:
- sometimes too simple & reduced: Slice operations
- missing generics lead to multiple implementations of the same algorithm

## Recommended open source libraries

- [github.com/gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux): HTTP-request multiplexer, compatible with standard HTTP-Server
  - [Gorilla Toolkit](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/): many useful tools around HTTP-Server
- [github.com/google/uuid](https://github.com/google/uuid): UUID data structure
- [github.com/spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra): CLI library (Docker & K8s is using it)
- [github.com/sirupsen/logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus): Often used logging library
- [gocloud.dev](https://gocloud.dev): *cloud development kit* for cross-*cloud platform* interaction (â†’ multi- & hybrid-cloud)

## Typical use cases

- Microservices
- CLI-Applications
  - cross-compiling
  - example: Docker, Kubernetes CLI
- Container eco-system (Docker, Kubernetes)

## IDEs and Go

## Hello World API as container

The example code can be found here:

.link https://github.com/wumaxd/golang-presentation/tree/main/exercises/helloWorldAPI

- Go compiles to native executables of the target architecture
- Allows us to use Alpine Linux (or UBI)
- Results in really small images with fast start-up time
